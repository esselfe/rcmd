rcmd is a reverse (from cloud to home) remote shell access program.
I started this project since I could ssh to my server from home,
but couldn't ssh home from my server since my ISP blocks inbound
traffic. The program runs in daemon mode at home and in listen mode
on the server.

The program uses a simple symmetric encryption using a key which
can be generated randomly. This key will be used for random substitution
cipher processing of transmitting text. Note that non-alpha chars
found in binary data is not crypted.

To compile the program, run 'make' within the source directory.
Run './rcmd -h' to see all available options.
